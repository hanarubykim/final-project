As we look at the parameters for the following racial subgroups, we are able to see how our prediction for the percentage proficient will change depending on the racial subgroup. A positive parameter value means a higher proficiency percentage relative to the prediction for Asian students while a negative parameter value means a lower percentage. For instance, the parameter for Hispanic students is estimated to be -0.207. This means that in comparison to the Asian students as a whole, this subgroup in particular is predicted to be performing 20.7% less proficiently as a racial subgroup on the state exam, which totals to about 29.7%.

As we are still considering Asian students as the \"baseline\" for our subsequent calculations, we need to recognize that the -0.002 is the difference in the change between proficiency within Asian and Black students as they ascend a grade. So, we must add the -0.002 to the baseline of -0.025 to get a total of -0.027, which tells us that for every grade ascended, a Black student is 2.7% less likely to score proficiently on their math examination. If we refer back to the \"baseline\", an Asian student, in comparison, is 2.5% less likely to score proficiently on their math examination for every grade ascended. We can see that overall, academic proficiency on math examinations for all racial subgroups are predicted to fall as they ascend grades.

Around 37.1% of Black students in the third grade are predicted to be performing proficiently, in comparison to 71.8% of their Asian peers."),

On the other hand, for schools with increasing percentages of Black students, there was a downwards trend in academic performance for several groups.
